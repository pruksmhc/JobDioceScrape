Repository for code for dioce data scraping.
For context, we want dioces from before 1700, and we want:
For each bishop:
-Name
-From (when did the bishop take their role from?)
-To (when did the bihsop leave their role?)
-Biography (in English)
-URL
-Name of dioce

We translate from German wikipedia.
main.py does everything.
